Landsat-based-WUI-mapping

1. System requirements
This code was developed for R (version R-4.4.1) and imports the following packages: raster.

2. Installation guide
The code can be downloaded and immediately used on any machine that satisfies the system requirements and installed R version.

3. Demo
This repository provides a demo inlcuding all required datasets.

Run Landsat-WUI_mapping_Adelaide.R as an example for creating a 2020 WUI map for Adeladie (Australia). Adjustments are required for input path and output path in the script. The resulting wildland-urban interface map will be saved to the output directory.

The expected runtime is ca. 35 seconds in total.

4. Instructions for use
Intermediate data for other tiles than the demo tiles are currently not available for download due to file sizes. Intermediate building and other land cover data can, however, be re-creatd using basic GIS functionalities (moving window averaging and buffering).
